# AutobotEnglishTranslator
Converting between English and Autobot using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This project was mainly used as an introduction to web programming and development, and also working with files in JavaScript. Hopefully some of the concepts used here can become helpful later on in making a tool hosted with Pages that can create and modify files for the user.
